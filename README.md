Orange is a statically typed, multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented) systems programming language with a focus on high productivity and extendability.

Orange _Mini_ is a subset of Orange used to bootstrap the compiler. It lacks the following features from the full language:

- Strict aliases
- Tuples
- Short blocks
- Yield
- ADT Enums
- Switch statement
- Default values for parameters
- Named arguments 
- Implicit Generic Types
- Partial Classes
- UTF-8 support. (ASCII only in this version)
- Placeholder (`_`) variable.

# Goals

- _Be Productive_. Provide a simple syntax for writing code quickly and make it easy to download and install project dependencies. Provide strict type checking to make sure basic type errors canâ€™t happen.
- _Be Extendible_. Allow developers to extend new interfaces to existing types, and allow for creating/downloading compiler extensions that can add new language features and code checks.
- _Be Flexible_. Combine the extendibility and productivity to make Orange suitable for any kind of development, from embedded programming to high-level applications like web servers.

# Building
Building on OS X and Linux should be straightforward. Make sure git and CMake are installed and then run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/orange-lang/orange.git
$ cd orange
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir build-orange && cd build-orange
$ cmake ..
$ make all install
```

Building on Windows is supported through [MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io)
